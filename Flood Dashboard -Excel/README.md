#  Flood Vulnerability Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an **Excel-based dashboard** designed to analyze flood vulnerability across global cities using parameters such as rainfall, elevation, land use, drainage density, and soil distribution.

---

##  Dashboard Overview
The dashboard provides interactive visuals and key performance indicators (KPIs) including:

- **Average Rainfall**  
- **Extreme Risk Cities**  
- **Maximum Elevation**  
- **Total Cities Analyzed**

### Key Charts:
- Rainfall by City  
- Elevation by City  
- Flood Risk by City  
- Land Use Distribution  
- Soil Group Distribution  
- Average Drainage Density by City

##  Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Power Query  
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Slicers & Filters  
  - Data Visualization (Charts & KPIs)

---

##  Insights
- Identified high-risk flood cities with extreme rainfall and low elevation.
